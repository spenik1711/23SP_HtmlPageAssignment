    <p>My name is Nik Spencer. Yes, I know my name is spelled weird. My Mom did not want a "C" in my name. 
      In fact she did not want a "C" in my middle name either. Which unfortunatly means my middle name is spelled
      Patrik.

      This is my sixth year at Pittstate. I began as a Pre-Med Major but quickly found that it was 
      not the correct path for me and changed to a Computer Information Systems Major. I hope to one day open a dinner theatre
      restaraunt with my girlfriend/ future wife, who is featured in the picture above.

      In my free time I enjoy designing and building computers for friends and family. I also enjoy playing video games with friends and playing Dungeons and Dragons. I, however, am the forever DM (Dungeon Master). I am the one who builds the worlds everyone plays their characters in and I also make the story line in which they follow.
